<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE</h2>


<p>The only reason for printing this little book is that many people have
expressed a desire to have the memorial poem, "Golden Stars," in a
permanent form.</p>

<p>The other verses are included simply because they are a wayside record
of some of the varied feelings of an old lover of peace who was willing
to fight for it,&mdash;feelings which may find a response in other American
hearts.</p>

I have no joy in strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace is my great desire;</span><br />
Yet God forbid I lose my life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through fear to face the fire.</span><br />

A peaceful man must fight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that which peace demands,&mdash;</span><br />
Freedom and faith, honor and right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Defend with heart and hands.</span><br />

Farewell, my friendly books;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell, ye woods and streams;</span><br />
The fate that calls me forward looks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a duty beyond dreams.</span><br />

Oh, better to be dead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a face turned to the sky,</span><br />
Than live beneath a slavish dread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And serve a giant lie.</span><br />

Stand up, my heart, and strive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the things most dear to thee!</span><br />
Why should we care to be alive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless the world is free?</span><br />

<p>The winds of war-news change and veer<br />
Now westerly and full of cheer,<br />
Now easterly, depressing, sour<br />
With tidings of the Teutons' power.</p>

<p>But thou, America, whose heart<br />
With brave Allies has taken part,<br />
Be not a weathercock to change<br />
With these wild winds that shift and range.</p>

<p>Be thou a compass ever true,<br />
Through sullen clouds or skies of blue,<br />
To that great star which rules the night,&mdash;<br />
The star of Liberty and Right.</p>

<p>Lover of peace, oh set thy soul,<br />
Thy strength, thy wealth, thy conscience whole,<br />
To win the peace thine eyes foresee,&mdash;<br />
The triumph of Democracy.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of hatred, as many kinds of fire;<br />
And some are fierce and fatal with murderous desire;<br />
And some are mean and craven, revengeful, sullen, slow,<br />
They hurt the man that holds them more than they hurt his foe.</p>

<p>And yet there is a hatred that purifies the heart:<br />
The anger of the better against the baser part,<br />
Against the false and wicked, against the tyrant's sword,<br />
Against the enemies of love, and all that hate the Lord.</p>

<p>O cleansing indignation, O flame of righteous wrath,<br />
Give me a soul to feel thee and follow in thy path!<br />
Save me from selfish virtue, arm me for fearless fight,<br />
And give me strength to carry on, a soldier of the Right!</p>

O dark the night and dim the day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When first our flag arose;</span><br />
It fluttered bravely in the fray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet o'erwhelming foes.</span><br />
Our fathers saw the splendor shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They dared and suffered all;</span><br />
They won our freedom by the sign&mdash;<br />
The holy sign, the radiant sign&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the stars that never fall.</span><br />

<p><i>Chorus</i></p>

All hail to thee, Young Glory!<br />

We'll ne'er forget the story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of thy heroic birth.</span><br />

O wild the later storm that shook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pillars of the State,</span><br />
When brother against brother took<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The final arms of fate.</span><br />
But union lived and peace divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enfolded brothers all;</span><br />
The flag floats o'er them with the sign&mdash;<br />
The loyal sign, the equal sign&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the stars that never fall.</span><br />

<p><i>Chorus</i></p>

All hail to thee, Old Glory!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of thee our heart's desire</span><br />
Foretells a golden story,<br />

O fiercer than all wars before<br />

The Giant Robber's world-wide war<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the things that shall not be!</span><br />
Thy sister banners hold the line;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To thee, dear flag, they call;</span><br />
And thou hast joined them with the sign&mdash;<br />
The heavenly sign, the victor sign&mdash;<br />

<p>Who knows how many thousand years ago<br />
The twelvefold Zodiac was made to show<br />
The course of stars above and men below?</p>

<p>The great sun plows his furrow by its "lines":<br />
From all its "houses" mystic meaning shines:<br />
Deep lore of life is written in its "signs."</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Aries</i>&mdash;Sacrifice.</span><br />

<p>Snow-white and sacred is the sacrifice<br />
That Heaven demands for what our heart doth prize:<br />
The man who fears to suffer, ne'er can rise.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Taurus</i>&mdash;Strength.</span><br />

<p>Rejoice, my friend, if God has made you strong:<br />
Put forth your force to move the world along:<br />
Yet never shame your strength to do a wrong.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gemini</i>&mdash;Brotherhood.</span><br />

<p>Bitter his life who lives for self alone,<br />
Poor would he be with riches and a throne:<br />
But friendship doubles all we are and own.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Cancer</i>&mdash;The Wisdom of Retreat.</span><br />

<p>Learn from the crab, O runner fresh and fleet,<br />
Sideways to move, or backward, when discreet;<br />
Life is not all advance,&mdash;sometimes retreat!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Leo</i>&mdash;Fire.</span><br />

<p>The sign of Leo is the sign of fire.<br />
Hatred we hate: but no man should desire<br />
A heart too cold to flame with righteous ire.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Virgo</i>&mdash;Love.</span><br />

<p>Mysterious symbol, words are all in vain<br />
To tell the secret power by which you reign,<br />
The more we love, the less we can explain.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Libra</i>&mdash;Justice.</span><br />

<p>Examine well the scales with which you weigh;<br />
Let justice rule your conduct every day;<br />
For when you face the Judge you'll need fair play</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Scorpio</i>&mdash;Self-Defense.</span><br />

<p>There's not a creature in the realm of night<br />
But has the wish to live, likewise the right:<br />
Don't tread upon the scorpion, or he'll fight.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Sagittarius</i>&mdash;The Archer.</span><br />

<p>Life is an arrow, therefore you must know<br />
What mark to aim at, how to use the bow,&mdash;<br />
Then draw it to the head and let it go!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Capricornus</i>&mdash;The Goat.</span><br />

<p>The goat looks solemn, yet he likes to run,<br />
And leap the rocks, and gambol in the sun:<br />
The truly wise enjoy a little fun.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Aquarius</i>&mdash;Water.</span><br />

<p>"Like water spilt upon the ground,"&mdash;alas,<br />
Our little lives flow swiftly on and pass;<br />
Yet may they bring rich harvests and green grass!</p>

<p>Last of the sacred signs, ye bring to me<br />
A word of hope, a word of mystery,&mdash;<br />
We all are swimmers in God's mighty sea.</p>

<p>Under the cloud of world-wide war,<br />
While earth is drenched with sorrow,<br />
I have no heart for idle merrymaking,<br />
Or for the fashioning of glad raiment.&mdash;<br />
I will retrace the divine footmarks,<br />
On the Road of the first Easter</p>

<p>Down through the valley of utter darkness<br />
Dripping with blood and tears;<br />
Over the hill of the skull, the little hill of great anguish,<br />
The ambuscade of Death.<br />
Into the no-man's-land of Hades<br />
Bearing despatches of hope to spirits in prison,<br />
Mortally stricken and triumphant<br />
Went the faithful Captain of Salvation.</p>

<p>Then upward, swiftly upward,&mdash;<br />
Victory, liberty, glory,<br />
The feet that were wounded walked in the tranquil garden,<br />
Bathed in dew and the light of deathless dawn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
O my soul, my comrades, soldiers of freedom,<br />
Follow the pathway of Easter, for there is no other,<br />
Follow it through to peace, yea, follow it fighting.</p>

<p>This Armageddon is not darker than Calvary.<br />
The day will break when the Dragon is vanquished;<br />
He that exalteth himself as God shall be cast down,<br />
And the Lords of war shall fall,<br />
And the long, long terror be ended,<br />
Victory, justice, peace enduring!<br />
They that die in this cause shall live forever,<br />
And they that live shall never die,<br />
They shall rejoice together in the Easter of a new world.</p>

They stained the wave with martyr-blood,&mdash;but we sent our transports through!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>What flags are these that dumbly droop from the gaff o' the mainmast tall?<br />
The black of the Kaiser's iron cross, the red of the Empire's fall!<br />
Come down, come down, ye pirate flags. Yea, strike your colors all.</p>

<p>The Union Jack and the Tricolor and the Starry Flag o' the West<br />
Shall guard the fruit of Freedom's war and the victory confest,<br />
The flags of the brave and just and free shall rule on the ocean's breast.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A mighty shout,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ye lovers of the sea!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The "Kaiser" and the "Kaiserin,"</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The "K&ouml;nig" and the "Prinz"</i></span><br />

<p>I</p>

<p>It was my lot of late to travel far<br />
Through all America's domain,<br />
A willing, grey-haired servitor<br />
Bearing the Fiery Cross of righteous war.<br />
And everywhere, on mountain, vale and plain,<br />
In crowded street and lonely cottage door,<br />
I saw the symbol of the bright blue star.<br />
Millions of stars! Rejoice, dear land, rejoice<br />
That God hath made thee great enough to give<br />
Beneath thy starry flag unfurled<br />
A gift to all the world,&mdash;<br />
Thy living sons that Liberty might live.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>II</p>

<p>It seems but yesterday they sallied forth<br />
Boys of the east, the west, the south, the north,<br />
High-hearted, keen, with laughter and with song,<br />
Fearless of lurking danger on the sea,<br />
Eager to fight in Flanders or in France<br />
Against the monstrous German wrong,<br />
And sure of victory!<br />
Brothers in soul with British and with French<br />
They held their ground in many a bloody trench;<br />
And when the swift word came&mdash;<br />
<i>Advance!</i><br />
Over the top they went through waves of flame,&mdash;<br />
Confident, reckless, irresistible,<br />
Real Americans,&mdash;<br />
Their rush was never stayed<br />
Until the foe fell back, defeated and dismayed.<br />
O land that bore them, write upon thy roll<br />
Of battles won<br />
To liberate the human soul,<br />
Ch&acirc;teau Thierry and Saint Mihiel<br />
And the fierce agony of the Argonne;<br />
Yea, count among thy little rivers, dear<br />
Because of friends whose feet have trodden there,<br />
The Marne, the Meuse, and the Moselle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>III</p>

<p>Now the vile sword<br />
In Potsdam forged and bathed in hell,<br />
Is beaten down, the victory given<br />
To the sword forged in faith and bathed in heaven.<br />
Now home again our heroes come:<br />
Oh, welcome them with bugle and with drum,<br />
Ring bells, blow whistles, make a joyful noise<br />
Unto the Lord,<br />
And welcome home our blue-star boys,<br />
Whose manhood has made known<br />
To all the world America,<br />
Unselfish, brave and free, the Great Republic,<br />
Who lives not to herself alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>But many a lad we hold<br />
Dear in our heart of hearts<br />
Is missing from the home-returning host.<br />
Ah, say not they are lost,<br />
For they have found and given their life<br />
In sacrificial strife:<br />
Their service stars have changed from blue to gold!<br />
That sudden rapture took them far away,<br />
Yet are they here with us today,<br />
Even as the heavenly stars we cannot see<br />
Through the bright veil of sunlight<br />
Shed their influence still<br />
On our vexed life, and promise peace<br />
From God to all men of good will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>V</p>

<p>What wreaths shall we entwine
For our dear boys to deck their holy shrine?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mountain-laurel, morning-glory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goldenrod and asters blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purple loosestrife, prince's-pine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wild-azalea, meadow-rue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nodding-lilies, columbine,&mdash;</span><br />
All the native blooms that grew<br />
In these fresh woods and pastures new,<br />
Wherein they loved to ramble and to play.<br />
Bring no exotic flowers:<br />
America was in their hearts,<br />
And they are ours<br />
For ever and a day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>VI</p>

O happy warriors, forgive the tear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falling from eyes that miss you;</span><br />
Forgive the word of grief from mother-lips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ne'er on earth shall kiss you;</span><br />
Hear only what our hearts would have you hear,&mdash;<br />
Glory and praise and gratitude and pride<br />
From the dear country in whose cause you died.<br />
Now you have run your race and won your prize,<br />
Old age shall never burden you, the fears<br />
And conflicts that beset our lingering years<br />
Shall never vex your souls in Paradise.<br />
Immortal, young, and crowned with victory,<br />
From life's long battle you have found release.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And He who died for all on Calvary</span><br />
Has welcomed you, brave soldiers of the cross,<br />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into eternal Peace.</span><br />

<p>VII</p>

<p>Come, let us gird our loins and lift our load,<br />
Companions who are left on life's rough road,<br />
And bravely take the way that we must tread<br />
To keep true faith with our beloved dead.<br />
To conquer war they dared their lives to give,<br />
To safeguard peace our hearts must learn to live.<br />
Help us, dear God, our forward faith to hold!<br />
We want a better world than that of old.<br />
Lead us on paths of high endeavor,<br />
Toiling upward, climbing ever,<br />
Ready to suffer for the right,<br />
Until at last we gain a loftier height,<br />
More worthy to behold<br />
Our guiding stars, our hero-stars of gold.</p>
